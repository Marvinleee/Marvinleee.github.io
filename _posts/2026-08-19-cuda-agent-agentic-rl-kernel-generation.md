Abstract

GPU kernel optimization is fundamental to modern deep learning but remains a highly specialized task requiring deep hardware expertise. Despite strong performance in general programming, large language models (LLMs) remain uncompetitive with compiler-based systems such as torch.compile for CUDA kernel generation. Existing CUDA code generation approaches either rely on training-free refinement or fine-tune models within fixed multi-turn execution-feedback loops, while both paradigms fail to fundamentally improve the model’s intrinsic CUDA optimization ability, resulting in limited performance gains. We present CUDA Agent, a large-scale agentic reinforcement learning system that develops CUDA kernel expertise through three components: a scalable data synthesis pipeline, a skill-augmented CUDA development environment with automated verification and profiling to provide reliable reward signals, and RL algorithmic techniques enabling stable training. CUDA Agent achieves state-of-the-art results on KernelBench, delivering 100%, 100%, and 92% faster rate over torch.compile on KernelBench Level-1, Level-2, and Level-3 splits, outperforming the strongest proprietary models e.g. Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro by about 40% on the hardest Level-3 setting.

## 
1 Introduction

![[Uncaptioned image]](2602.24286v1/x1.png)

GPU kernels are a foundational component of modern deep learning infrastructure [[17], [12]], with NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture currently dominating the AI hardware ecosystem. Despite its widespread adoption, the development and optimization of high-performance CUDA kernels remain highly challenging, which requires a deep understanding of GPU microarchitectural features [[16]], and sophisticated profiling toolkits [[4]].

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated *human-comparable* proficiency in general software development tasks [[23]], existing CUDA kernel generation approaches [[4], [12]] still remain *uncompetitive* even with automatic optimization tools such as torch.compile in CUDA kernel code generation [[17]], let alone human experts.

One line of prior work on CUDA code generation focuses on designing training-free workflows [[5], [6], [8]], which rely on hand-designed refinement heuristics guided by execution feedback. However, these methods do not remedy the fundamental lack of CUDA-coding abilities in the base models, causing performance gains to be significantly capped by the model’s intrinsic capabilities. Another line of research [[4], [14], [11], [1]] attempts to fine tune base models within a fixed multi-turn refinement loop driven by code execution feedback. However, such methods waste context length by including all previous solutions and constrain the agent’s autonomy to learn debugging, search, and profiling strategies.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce CUDA Agent, a large-scale CUDA agent training system that systematically enhances the base model’s CUDA kernel coding capabilities by making contributions in three complementary dimensions: data, agent environment, and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithmic techniques.

To support large-scale reinforcement learning, we design a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates training problems spanning a wide range of difficulty levels, enabling effective curriculum-based RL training.
For the agent environment, we adopt the agent skills paradigm [[2]], equipping the model with a structured specification that formalizes the standard workflow for writing, validating and optimizing CUDA kernels, together with automated test and profiling scripts for execution-based feedback. Notably, we implement rigorous correctness and performance tests, along with system-level permission isolation, to prevent reward hacking and ensure accurate reward signals.
As for RL algorithmic improvement, we analyze the sources of instability in RL optimization and propose a multi-stage warm-up strategy for both the actor and critic models, enabling stable training of large language models for 150 steps.

Integrating these components, CUDA Agent successfully scales to a context length of 128k tokens and supports up to 200 interaction turns, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, CUDA Agent achieves speedups of 100%, 100%, and 92% over torch.compile on the Level-1, Level-2, and Level-3 splits of KernelBench [[17]], outperforming advanced proprietary models such as Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro111We found that models in the ChatGPT-5 series (5, 5.1, and 5.2) were not amenable to evaluation on this task, as they consistently declined to respond to CUDA-related prompts. by approximately 40% in the Level-3 split.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

- 
• 

We introduce CUDA Agent, a large-scale agentic reinforcement learning system for automatic CUDA kernel generation, which systematically improves the base model’s CUDA coding and optimization abilities through scalable data synthesis, a skill-augmented CUDA kernel development environment, and RL techniques designed for stable long-context, multi-turn agentic training.

- 
• 

CUDA Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on KernelBench, outperforming torch.compile in the majority of test cases and delivering the largest speedups across multiple difficulty levels. These results establish LLM-based kernel generation as a competitive—and often superior—alternative to traditional compiler-driven kernel optimization.

2 Related Works

### 
2.1 Training Free Systems for Kernel Generation

Several recent works explore designing with explicit search to address the irregular landscape of kernel optimization.
STARK [[5]] employs a strategic team of agents with planning, coding, and debugging roles that explore a tree-structured search space on KernelBench, iteratively refining kernels using compilation, correctness checks, and timing feedback.
ReGraphT [[6]] presents a training-free, retrieval-augmented framework that distills CUDA optimization trajectories from large language models into a reasoning graph, which is then searched via Monte Carlo Graph Search to guide smaller models toward competitive performance.
EvoEngineer [[8]] formulates CUDA kernel optimization as a constrained code evolution problem and applies an LLM-driven evolutionary loop that iteratively edits and validates kernels to improve performance while preserving correctness.
CudaForge [[26]] introduces a training-free two-agent system where a Judge uses Nsight Compute profiling and hardware specifications to diagnose bottlenecks and provide targeted optimization feedback to a Coder, achieving consistent speedups across GPUs.

Although these works demonstrate considerable performance gains, they heavily rely on the base model’s CUDA coding capability. Furthermore, those test-time scaling approaches are also orthogonal and could be applied to our model.

### 
2.2 Fine-tuning LLM for Kernel Generation

In parallel, another line of research seeks to improve CUDA kernel generation by training base models via supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.
Kevin [[4]] introduces a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework for CUDA kernels that models the iterative developer workflow, achieving notable gains in both correctness and performance over its QwQ-32B base model on KernelBench.
CUDA-L1 [[14]] proposes a contrastive reinforcement learning framework that evaluates multiple CUDA kernel variants using execution-based rewards. However, their training and evaluation are conducted on the same KernelBench dataset without a proper train–test split. This data leakage renders the reported results not directly comparable to ours.
ConCuR [[11]] synthesize and curate CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, and uses the resulting dataset to fine-tune QwQ-32B into KernelCoder, achieving performance improvment among open-source models.

Overall, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality training data, limited training scale, and hand-designed optimization loops, which collectively cap their performance improvements. A more detailed analysis and comparison of these related works can be found in Appendix [8].

## 
3 Method

Our large-scale agentic reinforcement learning system CUDA Agent is built upon three key components: 1) a scalable data collection pipeline; 2) a skill-integrated and non-hackable training environment with robust reward scheduling designing; and 3) proposed reinforcement learning algorithmic techniques for stable training.
Each component plays a crucial role in achieving the final strong empirical results.

### 
3.1 Scalable Training Data Synthesis Pipeline

The scarcity of high-performance CUDA kernels creates a significant bottleneck for supervised fine-tuning, as manual implementation of expert-level reference code is prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) for training CUDA Agent. RL necessitates a vast and diverse corpus of reference operators implemented in PyTorch to serve as training tasks. Since existing public datasets lack the requisite diversity and scale, we develop a scalable data collection pipeline that systematically expands the task space through seed problem crawling, LLM-based combinatorial synthesis, and rigorous execution-based filtering (Figure [1]).

The key observation for our combination based data synthesis is composing multiple operators into fused tasks yields valuable new CUDA-agent training problem. This is because the combined problem is often not equivalent to trivially optimizing each operator in isolation and then chaining them. Fusion reshapes the optimization landscape by avoiding intermediate global-memory materialization, coupling stages through shared register/SMEM/occupancy constraints, and requiring a unified parallel mapping and data layout that may favor downstream consumption.

Seed Problem Crawling First, we mine reference operator implemented in PyTorch from the torch and transformers libraries, establishing a comprehensive seed problem set. Each operator is represented as a Python class with initialization and forward methods. These operator classes are widely used and well-maintained. We therefore exclude individually maintained repositories that lack sufficient code quality.

Combinatorial Problem Construction Next, to expand the dataset and introduce higher complexity, we utilize LLMs to synthesize aggregated operators. Specifically, the LLM is prompted to sample no more than 5 operator classes from the torch library. The sampled operator classes are composed sequentially by stacking them into a single computational layer. We do not sample operator classes from the transformers library, as these operators are typically higher-level modules that already encapsulate multiple primitive operations.

Problems Filtering Finally, we implement a rigorous data selection process to filter out problems that are either too easy or too difficult, based on execution feedback. We validate each operator against four criteria: (1) The operator must execute successfully in both Eager and Compile modes.
(2) To ensure reproducibility, we exclude operators with inherent stochasticity.
(3) For anti-hacking, we verify that outputs for different inputs are neither constant values nor numerically indistinguishable.
(4) To filter out trivial or excessively heavy tasks, we restrict the execution time in eager mode to the range of 1 ms to 100 ms. Furthermore, we exclude operators that exhibit high similarity to KernelBench test cases; the similarity distribution is provided in [section˜6].

In total, the filtered synthesized training dataset contains 6,000 samples, forming CUDA-Agent-Ops-6K222[https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/CUDA-Agent-Ops-6K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/CUDA-Agent-Ops-6K), a curated operator-level dataset for training CUDA-capable agents. Additional details on data format, contamination analysis, and dataset composition are provided in [section˜6].

### 
3.2 Skill-Integrated Agent Loop

Agent Loop As CUDA kernel coding naturally arises as a subtask of coding agents, we design our agent loop to align with the widely adopted OpenHands framework [[22]] to ensure the generalizability. The LLM is provided with a standard suite of shell utilities—BashTool, GlobTool, MultiEditTool, and TodoWriteTool—to fully support CUDA coding development (see [section˜7] for the full list). On top of this, our agent loop (visualized in [figure˜2]) follows the ReAct-style paradigm [[24]], interleaving reasoning, action execution, and observation to enable iterative coding, debugging, and performance optimization.

CUDA Coding Skill Inspired by the idea of Agent Skills [[2]], we deliberately put the CUDA coding specific instructions and tools (*e.g.* the profiling tool to compare the performance of generated kernel against torch.compile) as Agent Skills format. We also design a CUDA kernel coding specific instructions SKILL.md formulating the standard process to optimize the CUDA kernel (original text can be found in [section˜7]):

- 
1. 

Analyze the performance of the native PyTorch implementation using the provided profile.py script. This step identifies performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities, such as excessive kernel launches and suboptimal memory access patterns.

- 
2. 

Implement custom CUDA operators by rewriting the model in model_new.py and developing the corresponding CUDA kernel source files and binding code, targeting the performance-critical operators identified in the analysis stage.

- 
3. 

Compile and evaluate the optimized model in the provided GPU sandbox environment, and iteratively refine the CUDA kernel implementations until both numerical correctness and performance requirements are met.

- 
4. 

Repeat the optimization process starting from Step 2 until the final implementation achieves at least a 5% speedup over the torch.compile baseline while passing all numerical correctness checks.

_

Robust Reward Scheduling

Existing RL approaches for CUDA generation [[4], [14], [1]] use speedup over baselines as the reward signal. However, we observe that this approach suffers from outliers and bias toward easy kernels. This is because operators vary substantially in optimization difficulty, making raw speedup an unreliable proxy for code quality. To address this, we propose a normalized, robust reward scheme to remedy this and jointly optimize correctness and execution latency.

We assign a reward score 

$$
r\in\{-1,1,2,3\}
$$

 based on correctness and performance:

$$
r=\begin{cases}-1&\text{if correctness check fails}\\
3&\text{if }b(t,t_{\text{eager}})\land b(t,t_{\text{compile}})\\
2&\text{if }b(t,t_{\text{eager}})\\
1&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}
$$

(1)

where 

$$
t
$$

 is the generated kernel’s runtime, 

$$
t_{\text{native}}
$$

 and 

$$
t_{\text{compile}}
$$

 are the runtimes of PyTorch’s eager implementation and torch.compile version respectively, and 

$$
b(t,t_{0})=\mathbb{I}\left[(t_{0}-t)/t_{0}>5\%\right]
$$

 indicates a significant speedup over baseline 

$$
t_{0}
$$

. We validate this design in [section˜4.3.2] that it significantly outperforms the commonly used speedup reward.

Efforts to Avoid Reward Hacking We note that previous work Lange et al. [[12]] suffer from the hacking issue [[9]]. Specifically, our system enforces the following constraints to avoid reward hacking:
1) the provided Python scripts for correctness verification and performance profiling are protected via file permission controls, preventing the agent from modifying or interfering with the evaluation logic;
2) to avoid trivial fallbacks, we enforce execution-time constraints using context managers that explicitly forbid invoking fallback implementations from torch.nn.functional, ensuring that performance gains originate solely from the generated CUDA kernels;
3) for each problem, we validate kernel outputs against five randomly sampled inputs, strictly following the KernelBench evaluation protocol to ensure functional correctness;
4) the profiling pipeline is carefully engineered with proper device synchronization, warm-up iterations, and repeated measurements with averaging, substantially reducing measurement noise and metric fluctuation; and
5) the agent is not provided with any web search or external information retrieval tools, ensuring that all solutions are derived purely from local execution environment.

### 
3.3 Algorithmic Improvements for Stable RL Training

We observe that our initial RL trial could only train stably for 17 steps before the model’s performance collapsed. We identified the root cause of this instability and propose warming up both the actor and critic models to adapt to the model’s distribution.
With this modification, our RL trial can stably train for 200 steps with consistent reward growth.

The Root Cause of Training Instability stems from a severe domain distribution mismatch, where the base model’s learned prior deviates significantly from the data distribution required for CUDA kernel coding. This is because the CUDA coding data accounts for less than 0.01% of pretraining data [[13], [10]]. This distribution gap results in numerous sampled low-probability and CUDA kernel code tokens. Furthermore, when training and inference engines use different numerical precisions (e.g., BF16 vs FP16), those low-probability tokens result in large importance sampling ratio variance because small numerical errors in computing token probablities 

$$
\pi_{\theta}(y_{t})
$$

 near the precision floor (e.g., 

$$
\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}\mid s_{t})\approx 10^{-9}
$$

) cause the importance ratio 

$$
\rho_{t}(\theta)=\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}\mid s_{t})}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_{t}\mid s_{t})}
$$

 to fluctuate wildly or explode (similar to the discussion in Liu et al. [[15]]).

To achieve stable reinforcement learning, we propose a simple yet effective warm-up strategy: initializing both the actor and critic models using agent trajectories generated by the base model after single-turn RL, as illustrated in [figure˜3].

Single-Turn Warm-up We first perform single-turn RL on base model to enhance its capability in CUDA kernel generation. We use PPO for optimization, where the base model serves as the policy and value network.

Actor Initialization We then adopt a Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) stage on agent trajectories to initialize the actor model 

$$
\pi_{\theta}
$$

. The resulting model from single-turn RL is used to collect CUDA agent trajectories by running the agent in the agent loop from [section˜3.2]. Next, we apply RFT on the collected CUDA agent trajectories. Rejection sampling is performed to retain only high-quality rollouts according to the following rubrics:
(1) Outcome filtering: we only keep trajectories that achieve a positive reward (

$$
R>0
$$

).
(2) Pattern filtering: we discard trajectories that exhibit inefficient or invalid behaviors, such as redundant multi-turn loops or hallucinations that violate the predefined tool-call schema.

The filtered trajectories are then used to optimize the actor via standard supervised fine-tuning with the following objective:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{RFT}}(\theta)=-\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\mathcal{D^{\prime}}}\left[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\log\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}\mid s_{t},a_{

(2)

where 

$$
\tau=(s_{0},s_{1},\ldots,s_{T-1})
$$

 denotes a filtered CUDA agent trajectory, 

$$
\pi_{\theta}
$$

 is the policy parameterized by 

$$
\theta
$$

, and 

$$
\mathcal{D^{\prime}}
$$

 represents the dataset after rejection sampling.

Critic Initialization We perform Value Pretraining to initialize the critic, specifically, we utilize the sampled trajectory data comprising state sequences and their corresponding outcome rewards to pretrain the critic network. Let 

$$
\tau=(s_{0},s_{1},\ldots,s_{T-1})
$$

 denote a trajectory where 

$$
s_{t}
$$

 represents the state at token position 

$$
t
$$

, and let 

$$
r
$$

 denote the outcome reward assigned at the final token (i.e., 

$$
r_{t}=0
$$

 for 

$$
t[[19]]:

$$
V_{t}^{\text{targ}}=V_{\phi}(s_{t})+\hat{A}_{t},\quad\text{where}\quad\hat{A}_{t}=\sum_{l=0}^{T-1-t}(\gamma\lambda)^{l}\delta_{t+l},
$$

(3)

and 

$$
\delta_{t}=r_{t}+\gamma V_{\phi}(s_{t+1})-V_{\phi}(s_{t})
$$

 is the temporal difference error with 

$$
V_{\phi}(s_{T})=0
$$

. We set 

$$
\gamma=1
$$

 and 

$$
\lambda=0.95
$$

 in our experiments. We optimize the critic parameters 

$$
\phi
$$

 by minimizing the mean squared error:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{VP}}(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\mathcal{D}}\left[\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\left(V_{\phi}(s_{t})-V_{t}^{\text{targ}}\right)^{2}\right],
$$

where 

$$
\mathcal{D}

 denotes the collection of agent trajectories. We ablate the proposed initialization stage in [section˜4.3.3].

RL Algorithm 
We employ PPO [[18]] to optimize the actor model 

$$
\pi_{\theta}

.
Let 

$$
\pi_{\theta}

 denote the policy to be optimized, and 

$$
\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}
$$

 denote the policy used for trajectory sampling. We maximize the expected return using the clipped surrogate objective:

$$
\displaystyle\mathcal{L}^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau\sim\mathcal{D}}
$$

$$
\displaystyle\bigg[\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\min\big(\rho_{t}(\theta)\hat{A}_{t},
$$

(5)

$$
\displaystyle\text{clip}(\rho_{t}(\theta),1-\epsilon_{\text{lower}},1+\epsilon_{\text{higher}})\hat{A}_{t}\big)\bigg]
$$

where 

$$
\rho_{t}(\theta)=\frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}\mid s_{t})}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_{t}\mid s_{t})}
$$

 is the importance sampling ratio between the current and old policies,

### 
4.1 Experiment Settings

Training Settings for RL.
We leverage Seed1.6 [[20]] as the base model, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 23B active and 230B total parameters.
We set the global batch size to 1024, matching the mini-batch size for online PPO updates. Learning rate for actor and critic is 

$$
3\times{10^{-6}}
$$

 and 

$$
6\times{10}^{-6}
$$

. These hyper-parameters are shared between single-turn RL and agentic RL. Context window length is 32768 for single-turn RL and 131072 for agentic RL. We impose a maximum of 150 agent turns during training rollouts, which is relaxed to 200 agent turns during evaluation. The model is trained over 150 training steps.

Sandbox Environment To ensure accurate speedup measurement for reliable reward signals and efficient GPU utilization, we design a CPU–GPU resource–decoupled sandbox architecture. A Docker-based terminal sandbox handles CPU-centric tasks (e.g., kernel compilation), while the agent leverages pre-defined CUDA Agent skill scripts to dispatch verification and profiling jobs to a dedicated GPU sandbox pool (128 NVIDIA H20 GPUs). This process-level isolation and exclusive resource allocation eliminate inter-process interference, ensuring stable latency measurements and guaranteed HBM capacity.

Benchmark. We conduct our evaluations on KernelBench [[17]], utilizing the Level 1 to Level 3 subsets which comprise a total of 250 distinct operator tasks. To ensure fair comparison, we adapt these tasks from their original single-file format into our multi-file development environment (Section [3.2]).

Baseline Models. We compare our approach against frontier proprietary coding models: Claude Opus 4.5 [[3]] and Gemini 3 Pro  [[7]], as well as two powerful open-source coding models: GLM 4.6 [[27]] and Kimi K2 [[21]]. These models currently hold leading positions on major coding agent leaderboards and serve as strong baselines for general-purpose reasoning and coding capabilities. For fair comparison, baseline models are evaluated under the same agent loop mentioned in Section [3.2].

Evaluation Metrics. We assess performance using three key metrics: (1) Pass Rate, the percentage of tasks where the agent generates a kernel that successfully compiles and passes functional correctness checks; (2) Faster Rate, the percentage of tasks where the generated kernel is correct and achieves a faster execution time than the baseline (eager and compile modes); and (3) Speed-up, the geometric mean of the execution speed-up ratio relative to the baselines, computed exclusively for correct solutions.
To determine the final metrics for each task, we extract the best-performing solution from the agent’s interaction trajectory, specifically the one that achieves the maximum speed-up relative to torch.compile.

### 
4.2 Main Results

Table [1] summarizes the performance of CUDA Agent against strong proprietary model baselines on KernelBench. Our analysis yields three primary insights regarding the efficacy of agentic RL for CUDA kernel optimization.

First, when compared to strong proprietary models, CUDA Agent delivers substantially stronger CUDA kernel coding performance. Although Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro achieve respectable Pass Rates (91.2%–95.2%), their faster rates remain low at 66%–69%, indicating that general-purpose LLMs often produce naïve kernels that fail to outperform torch.compile. In contrast, CUDA Agent attains a 98.8% Pass Rate and a 96.8% faster rate, demonstrating that specialized RL training enables consistently correct and highly optimized CUDA implementations.

Second, compared to static torch.compile, CUDA Agent prove that *learned optimization policies can consistently outperform static compiler heuristics*, particularly in complex scenarios like operator fusion. This is most evident in Level 2 tasks (Operator Sequences), where CUDA Agent achieves a perfect 100% faster rate and a massive 2.80

$$
\times
$$

 speed-up over torch.compile. Traditional compilers rely on predefined, rule-based patterns for kernel fusion which often struggle with non-trivial operator combinations. By contrast, CUDA Agent explores a much larger design space through its iterative agent loop, discovering hardware-specific memory access patterns and tiling strategies that remain inaccessible to static backends.

### 
4.3 Ablation Studies

#### 
4.3.1 Impact of Skill-Integrated Agent Loop

To assess the critical role of the interactive environment in policy learning, we train two separate models under distinct protocols:
(1) single-turn model, trained using a standard code generation objective where the model predicts the final kernel and bindings in a single turn without execution feedback, serving as a warm-up stage in our training pipeline, and
(2) CUDA Agent, trained following the complete training pipeline, allowing the policy to see compilation errors and profiler feedback in multi-turn interactions.

Table [2] highlights the limitations of single-turn code generation and underscores the necessity of our skill-integrated agent loop. Removing the agent loop causes a substantial drop in both correctness and optimization quality. More importantly, the resulting kernels are not only less optimized but often regress in performance. Being exposed to compilation errors, runtime failures, and profiler feedback, the agent can iteratively diagnose mistakes and refine transformations across turns.

#### 
4.3.2 Impact of Reward Design

To determine the optimal shaping of reward for kernel optimization, we evaluate two different reward formulations: (1) speed-up reward, a continuous reward signal defined as 

$$
r_{s}=t_{\text{compile}}/t_{\text{gen}}
$$

 for correct solutions and 

$$
-1
$$

 for incorrect ones; and (2) our robust reward schedule ([figure˜3]), which assigns discrete values for achieving specific performance milestones .

As shown in Table [2], reward design has a pronounced effect on optimization outcomes. Replacing our robust reward schedule with a raw Speed-up Reward (w/o Robust Reward) yields comparable functional correctness, but substantially weaker optimization performance.

These results indicate that a normalized, milestone-based reward is better aligned with the goal of producing consistently faster kernels. By assigning credit to clear performance targets rather than directly regressing on noisy runtime ratios, the policy more reliably discovers transformations that translate into real speed-ups relative to both eager execution and compiler baselines.

#### 
4.3.3 Impact of Multi-Stage Training

As shown in Table [2], removing either RFT or Value Pretraining leads to substantial degradation in optimization performance, despite largely preserved pass rates.
More importantly, both ablations exhibit training instability and eventual collapse, motivating a closer analysis of the two stages below.

![Refer to caption]

_(a) Training Reward._

![Refer to caption]

_(b) Actor Entropy._

_Figure 4: Ablation: RFT. Removing RFT causes training reward to collapse. The concurrent increase in actor entropy suggests that the policy becomes increasingly diffuse and poorly structured._

Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) provides a critical prior that prevents policy collapse.
As shown in Figure [4(a)], removing the RFT stage results in a rapid and catastrophic collapse of training rewards.
To diagnose the underlying cause, we examine the policy entropy in Figure [4(b)], which reveals a sharp increase coinciding with the reward collapse.
This entropy surge indicates that the policy distribution becomes increasingly diffuse, producing incoherent and poorly structured outputs. By initializing the policy with a strong behavioral prior, RFT constrains the entropy growth during reinforcement learning and keeps the optimization trajectory within a well-structured output distribution.

![Refer to caption]

_(a) Explained Variation of Value Function._

![Refer to caption]

_(b) Response Length Clipped Ratio._

_Figure 5: Ablation: Value Pretraining. Without Value Pretraining, the critic fails to learn a meaningful value function, as reflected by low explained variance. This leads to inefficient exploration, manifested as excessively long interaction trajectories._

Value Pretraining is indispensable for providing reliable advantage estimates and preventing pathological search behaviors. Without an initialized critic, the model fails to capture the value landscape of the multi-turn interaction states (Figure [5(a)]). This poor estimation leads to an explosion in trajectory length (Figure [5(b)]), as the uninitialized critic fails to penalize fruitless or redundant search paths. Value Pretraining ensures that the critic can immediately provide accurate feedback, guiding the agent toward efficient optimization paths and avoiding the computational instability of near-infinite interaction loops.

## 
5 Conclusion

We introduced CUDA Agent, a large-scale agentic reinforcement learning system that endows large language models with the ability to generate and optimize CUDA kernels under realistic, execution-driven development workflows. By jointly scaling data synthesis, agent environments, and stability-oriented RL training, CUDA Agent moves LLMs beyond syntactic code generation toward hardware-aware performance optimization, achieving consistent gains over torch.compile and strong proprietary models on KernelBench. These results suggest a broader consequence: equipping foundation models with structured environments and reliable execution-based rewards can transform them from passive code generators into active systems optimizers, opening a path toward automating performance-critical software development in GPU computing.

6 Details of Collected Training Data

_(a) transformers operator class_

![Refer to caption]

_(b) Combinatorial torch operator class_

_Figure 6: Examples of operator classes in our training data._

Operator Format.
Each training sample is represented as a Python class implemented in PyTorch. Specifically, each operator is defined as a subclass of torch.nn.Module, with an __init__ method for parameter initialization and a forward method specifying the computation.
In addition to the operator class, each sample includes two auxiliary functions: get_init_inputs(), which constructs the inputs required to instantiate the operator class, and get_inputs(), which generates runtime inputs for the forward method. Together, the operator class and these auxiliary input-generation functions form a self-contained and executable training task. Figure [6] shows representative examples of operator classes used in our training data.

![Refer to caption]

_Figure 7: Distribution of the maximum AST similarity between each training sample and all evaluation samples._

Data Contamination Check.

To prevent overlap between training data and evaluation benchmarks, we perform an explicit decontamination step using an off-the-shelf AST-based code similarity tool. Specifically, we extract the Model class from each program and compute pairwise structural similarity between training and evaluation samples using PythonASTSimilarity. A training sample is removed if its maximum similarity to any evaluation program exceeds 0.9. After this filtering, we confirm that no training sample exhibits high AST-level similarity with the evaluation set. Figure [7] shows the distribution of the maximum AST similarity between each training sample and all evaluation samples. The majority of training samples exhibit low similarity scores, and no sample exceeds the decontamination threshold after filtering.

Final Dataset Composition.

Table [3] summarizes the composition of the final training dataset after data synthesis and filtering. The majority of training samples are composite operator classes constructed by sequentially stacking between one and five operator classes from the torch library. We report the distribution of composite operators by composition depth, where a

 primitive operator classes.
In addition, the dataset includes a set of operator classes directly taken from the transformers library, which are included as standalone operators and are not involved in compositional construction. This distribution reflects a deliberate balance between simple operators, moderately complex compositions, and higher-level transformers modules.

7 Details of Agent Loop

### 
7.1 Full List of Provided Tools

We equip the agent with a structured toolset that abstracts common developer operations into callable interfaces. These tools define the action space of the agent and serve as the only mechanisms through which it can interact with the system and the external world.

The agent is provided with a suite of tools for controlled interaction with the local execution environment:

Bash.
Executes shell commands in a persistent session under strict safety constraints (e.g., command quoting rules and directory validation). It enables compilation, dependency management, and program execution.

Read / Write.
Provide read-only and write access to local files. Write operations are guarded by a read-before-write policy to prevent blind overwriting.

Edit / MultiEdit.
Support deterministic string-level code modifications. Edit performs single replacements, while MultiEdit enables multiple atomic edits within one file, ensuring consistency across dependent code changes.

Glob.
Performs fast file discovery using glob patterns (e.g., **/*.py), allowing the agent to navigate large codebases efficiently.

Grep.
A structured code search interface based on ripgrep, supporting regex search, file-type filtering, and contextual line retrieval.

NotebookEdit.
Enables structured modification of Jupyter notebook cells, allowing the agent to operate in mixed code–analysis environments.

Together, these tools allow the agent to perform typical software engineering operations, including code inspection, refactoring, compilation, and debugging.

BashOutput.
Streams incremental outputs from background shell processes, enabling the agent to monitor long-running jobs (e.g., training or compilation).

KillBash.
Terminates background shell sessions when jobs hang or resources must be reclaimed.

\par### Step 4: Iteration Requirements

\par#### Correctness Failures

**MUST iterate until correctness passes - NO EXCEPTIONS**

- Continue until no further improvements possible or diminishing returns

\par**Remember**: The goal is the BEST possible performance, not just meeting the minimum!

\par### Step 5: Final Cleanup (MANDATORY BEFORE COMPLETION)

\parBefore declaring the task complete, clean up the kernels/ directory to contain ONLY the final optimized version:

8 Discussion of Concurrent Works

In this appendix, we provide a more detailed discussion of concurrent and closely related works, clarifying differences in problem settings, evaluation protocols, and training assumptions that make direct comparison with our method either inappropriate or non-informative.

STARK.

STARK adopts Claude Sonnet 4 as its base model and builds a structured multi-agent system consisting of specialized roles for planning, coding, and debugging. These agents follow a fixed execution program to explore a tree-structured search space. In contrast, our method employs a single agent that autonomously invokes tools, gathers feedback, and performs iterative kernel correction and optimization.
Although both methods are evaluated on KernelBench, the substantial difference between a fixed multi-agent pipeline and a single, autonomous agent makes direct comparison less meaningful. In addition, STARK does not explicitly specify the GPU hardware used for runtime evaluation, which further complicates precise performance comparison.

ReGraphT.

ReGraphT focuses on a distinct research question: transferring the optimization capabilities of large language models to smaller models via retrieval-augmented reasoning graphs and Monte Carlo Graph Search. As its primary goal is model compression and capability distillation rather than maximizing absolute kernel generation performance, we do not include direct performance comparisons with ReGraphT.

EvoEngineer.

EvoEngineer formulates kernel optimization as an evolutionary code editing process driven by LLM feedback. However, its evaluation is conducted on only 91 problems selected from the 250 tasks in KernelBench, rather than the full benchmark. This partial coverage introduces selection bias and limits the representativeness of the reported results, making direct comparison with our full-benchmark evaluation inappropriate.

CudaForge.

CudaForge adopts a two-agent workflow built on OpenAI-o3, where a Judge agent leverages Nsight Compute profiling signals and hardware specifications to diagnose performance bottlenecks and provide targeted optimization feedback to a Coder agent that applies code edits. Similar to STARK, this approach relies on predefined agent roles and a fixed interaction protocol. In contrast, our method employs a single agent that autonomously decides when to invoke tools, interprets feedback, and iteratively revises kernels in a self-directed manner.

Kevin.

Kevin introduces a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models the iterative CUDA development workflow. However, this approach partitions KernelBench into subsets for training and evaluation, effectively training on benchmark-derived tasks. As a result, the reported gains may partially reflect benchmark-specific adaptation rather than generalizable kernel generation capability, which limits the fairness of direct comparison with methods trained without access to KernelBench data.

CUDA-L1.

CUDA-L1 directly constructs supervised fine-tuning data from KernelBench reference implementations and further applies reinforcement learning using execution-based rewards on the same benchmark tasks. This practice results in significant data leakage between training and evaluation, rendering the reported performance not directly comparable to approaches, such as ours, that strictly avoid using KernelBench for training.

ConCuR.

ConCuR synthesizes CUDA kernels with reasoning traces generated by a Kevin-32B model and uses the resulting dataset to fine-tune KernelCoder. As previous mentioned,
Kevin-32B is trained on a KernelBench subset, so the performance of KernelCoder do not reflect training from independently curated or real-world kernel optimization data.

## 
9 Case Study

we conduct an in-depth case study on CUDA Agent’s optimization trajectories over Level 1 to Level 3 of KernelBench. For each level, we analyze a representative example and distill the key optimization applied by CUDA Agent.

### 
9.1 Common Optimization Patterns

Across all three difficulty levels in KernelBench, we observe several recurring optimization patterns in the trajectories generated by CUDA Agent.

Algebraic Simplification and Operator Reduction.

A dominant pattern is the use of algebraic reasoning to simplify high-level tensor expressions and reduce computational complexity. In Case [9.2], an explicit diagonal matrix multiplication is reduced to row-wise scaling, eliminating an entire matrix construction and GEMM. In Case [9.3], a matrix multiplication followed by reduction is transformed into a reduction over weights followed by a dot product. Such transformations replace generic, high-cost operators with simpler computations that are better aligned with the underlying mathematical structure.

Kernel Fusion.

Another recurring pattern is kernel fusion for eliminating intermediate tensors. Sequences of logically related operations are merged into a single kernel to avoid intermediate tensor materialization and reduce kernel launch overhead. Examples include collapsing multiple arithmetic stages (summation, dot product, division, and scaling) into a single kernel in Case [9.3], and fusing element-wise residual addition with activation functions in Case [9.4]. Fusion improves data locality and reduces global memory traffic.

Memory Access Optimization.

Efficient memory usage emerges as a key theme across cases. The generated kernels emphasize coalesced global memory accesses, reduced memory footprint by avoiding large intermediate tensors, and judicious use of shared memory for intra-block reductions. Vectorized loads (e.g., float4) are employed when beneficial to maximize memory bandwidth utilization.

Hardware-Aware Optimization.

For complex models, CUDA Agent demonstrates explicit awareness of GPU hardware capabilities and tailors the generated implementation accordingly. In Case [9.4], the system enables TF32 computation for both matrix multiplications and convolution operations, allowing the execution to leverage Tensor Cores on modern GPUs. By selectively adopting lower-precision arithmetic where it is performance-critical yet numerically acceptable, CUDA Agent achieves substantial speedups without requiring manual intervention.

Library-Aware Optimization.

In addition to custom kernel generation, CUDA Agent effectively leverages highly optimized vendor libraries when appropriate. In Case [9.4], the system identifies opportunities to invoke fused cuDNN APIs, such as convolution with bias and activation, to replace multiple separate operators. By mapping high-level model semantics onto optimized library primitives, CUDA Agent reduces kernel launch overhead and benefits from mature, hardware-tuned implementations provided by cuDNN.

Overall, these common patterns illustrate how CUDA Agent systematically bridges algorithmic insight and low-level performance engineering to optimize diverse workloads ranging from simple linear algebra to full neural network building blocks.

### 
9.2 Example of Level 1: Model that performs matrix multiplication of a diagonal matrix with another matrix

In this case, the reference model computes the product of a diagonal matrix constructed from a vector and a dense matrix. Although mathematically simple, this formulation incurs unnecessary computational and memory overhead by explicitly materializing the diagonal matrix and invoking a general matrix multiplication (GEMM). Figures [figures˜8], [9] and [10] illustrate the reference operator, the optimized CUDA kernel, and the resulting custom operator for this example. The Python/C++ binding is omitted for brevity. This custom operator achieves 73.31

$$
\times
$$

 speed-up versus Torch Compile.

CUDA Agent exploits the algebraic structure of diagonal matrix multiplication. Specifically, left-multiplying a matrix 

$$
B
$$

 by a diagonal matrix defined by vector 

$$
A
$$

 is equivalent to scaling each row 

$$
i
$$

 of 

$$
B
$$

 by the scalar 

$$
A[i]
$$

. This observation reduces the computation from a matrix–matrix multiplication to an element-wise broadcast multiplication, lowering the time complexity from 

$$
O(N^{2}M)
$$

 to 

$$
O(NM)
$$

.

Based on this simplification, CUDA Agent implements a custom CUDA kernel that directly performs the row-wise scaling without constructing the intermediate diagonal matrix. The kernel uses a grid-stride loop to efficiently cover all elements of the output matrix, and each thread independently multiplies one element of 

$$
B
$$

 by the corresponding diagonal entry from 

$$
A
$$

. This approach fuses the diagonal construction and matrix multiplication into a single kernel, significantly reducing kernel launch overhead and global memory traffic.

Overall, this case illustrates a common optimization pattern identified by CUDA Agent: recognizing implicit structure in high-level tensor expressions and replacing generic operators with specialized kernels that directly implement the underlying mathematical operation.

### 
9.3 Example of Level 2: Model that performs matrix multiplication, division, summation, and scaling

The second case involves a model composed of a sequence of operations, including matrix multiplication, division, summation, and scaling. Executed naively, this pipeline materializes large intermediate tensors and performs redundant computations. Figures [figures˜11], [12] and [13] show the reference operator, the fused CUDA kernel, and the final custom operator produced by CUDA Agent. The Python/C++ binding is omitted for brevity. This custom operator achieves 24.04

$$
\times
$$

 speed-up versus Torch Compile.

CUDA Agent begins with an algebraic rearrangement of the computation. By exploiting the linearity of summation and matrix multiplication, the operation can be rewritten as

$$
\sum_{j}\frac{x_{i}\cdot w_{j}^{T}}{2}=x_{i}\cdot\left(\sum_{j}w_{j}^{T}\right)/2,
$$

transforming a matrix–matrix multiplication followed by a reduction into a column-wise reduction of the weight matrix followed by a dot product. This significantly reduces both the number of floating-point operations and memory accesses.

CUDA Agent implement this transformation using two custom CUDA kernels. The first kernel computes the column-wise sum of the weight matrix with fully coalesced memory accesses. The second kernel performs the dot product between the input vector and the reduced weight vector, while simultaneously applying division and scaling. These operations are fused into a single kernel to avoid intermediate writes to global memory.

To further improve performance, the dot product kernel leverages vectorized memory access using float4 loads, maximizing memory bandwidth utilization. A shared-memory tree reduction is used within each thread block to accumulate partial sums efficiently, reducing synchronization overhead and avoiding expensive global atomics.

This case demonstrates how CUDA Agent systematically combines algorithmic simplification with kernel fusion and low-level CUDA optimizations to collapse a multi-operator computation graph into a small number of highly efficient kernels.

### 
9.4 Example of Level 3: ResNet BasicBlock

The third case studies a ResNet BasicBlock, representative of realistic deep learning workloads composed of convolutions, normalization, nonlinearities, and residual connections. The reference implementation follows the standard PyTorch execution path, resulting in multiple kernel launches for convolution, batch normalization, bias addition, activation, and residual addition. Figures [figures˜14], [15], [16], [17] and [18] present the reference ResNet BasicBlock, the optimized cuDNN-based convolution, the fused add–ReLU kernel, and the resulting custom operator. The Python/C++ binding is omitted for brevity. This custom operator achieves 3.59

$$
\times
$$

 speed-up versus Torch Compile.

CUDA Agent applies several complementary techniques. First, it manually folds the BatchNorm parameters into the preceding convolution weights and bias in the Python model, eliminating the BatchNorm operator entirely at inference time. This reduces both kernel launches and memory accesses while preserving numerical equivalence.

Second, by using cudnnConvolutionBiasActivationForward, CUDA Agent modifies the custom cuDNN convolution wrapper to enable convolution, bias addition, and ReLU activation to be executed within a single cuDNN kernel. This further reduces kernel launch overhead and improves data locality. We explicitly enable TF32 computation for cuDNN and matrix multiplication operations, allowing the implementation to leverage Tensor Cores on Hopper GPUs.

CUDA Agent also explores switching the data layout from NCHW to NHWC to better align with Tensor Core requirements. However, the required layout conversions introduced significant overhead, offsetting the potential gains. As a result, the final implementation retains the NCHW layout while using NCHW-compatible cuDNN APIs.

Finally, CUDA Agent fuses the residual addition and the final ReLU activation into a single custom CUDA kernel, replacing two separate element-wise operators. This kernel computes the element-wise sum of the main and residual branches and immediately applies the ReLU function.

Together, these optimizations reduce the number of kernel launches, improve arithmetic intensity, and better exploit hardware acceleration features. This case highlights CUDA Agent ’s ability to integrate high-level graph transformations with library-level fusion and custom kernel design in complex, real-world neural network blocks.

## 
10 Limitations

Our study has two main limitations. First, we do not compare CUDA Agent against more sophisticated compiler frameworks such as TVM. While these systems can potentially provide stronger baselines, they are difficult to integrate into a large-scale RL training loop with thousands of rollouts due to their substantial tuning overhead and complex deployment requirements; we therefore focus on torch.compile as a widely adopted, training-friendly baseline. Second, our training pipeline relies on a large GPU pool with process-level isolation, which incurs considerable computational and engineering cost. This reliance on massive GPU resources may limit accessibility for broader research community, and we leave exploring more resource-efficient training strategies as important directions for future work.
